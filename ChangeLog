   Changed: lib/linguistics/en/wordnet.rb

   - Calls to #synset no longer trap parse errors. This was done for two reasons:
   1. If the WordNet doesn't load, WordNet::ParseError is an undefined constant,
   so the function fails with a semi-ambiguous error message.
   2. The user of the library might wish to handle the parse failure herself.

   Changed: tests/en/linkparser.tests.rb

   - Changed parsing of non-sentences to expect errors in accordance with changes
   to the API of the LinkParser integration.


-- Sun, 14 Sep 2003 10:24:58 -0000 by deveiant (r50) -----
   Changed: lib/linguistics/en.rb

   Changed: lib/linguistics/en/linkparser.rb

   - Touched up the file description a bit.
   - @lpError now intitialized: bug spotted by Martin Chase.
   - Calls to #linkParse no longer trap parse errors. This was done for two
   reasons:
   1. If the LinkParser module doesn't load, LinkParser::ParseError is an
   undefined constant, so the function fails with a semi-ambiguous error
   message.
   2. The user of the library might wish to handle the parse failure herself.


-- Thu, 11 Sep 2003 05:04:55 -0000 by deveiant (r46) -----

   the modules on which they depend aren't installed), it doesn't count as a
