= Linguistics Module To-Do List

* Strip out the english specifics from the inflector class. Make it do pure
  delegation somehow
  * pick argument based on arity?

* Add missing Lingua::EN::Inflect features:
  * Number-insensitive Equality methods, e.g., +PL_eq()+, +PL_N_eq()+, etc.
  * String iterpolation methods? This can already be done via things like +"The
    #{'cat'.en.no(catCount)} in the hat."+, but it might be nice to have some
    more convenient notation and an #interpolate method.
  * User-defined inflections

* Ask the stemmable.rb authors if they'd let me put it into the en.rb module.

* Port more Perl modules:
  * Lingua::Phonology?
  * Others?
